During our exploration, we **stumbled upon** an ==uncharted mountain==. Intrigued by the challenge, we **impulsively decided** to climb it. However, with no designated paths and lacking of proper equipment, we find it to be ==**a treacherous journey** and **encountered various obstacles**.== Thorny branches **hooked our clothes, leaving us with scratched knees**, and the steep mountain surface made it challenging to find a foothold. The most thrilling moments were when we couldn't ==**confirm our exact position**== on the mountain due to the lack of clear signposts and references, and sometimes we even found ourselves repeatedly going back and forth in same places.

As we triumphantly reached the summit, the sun had already set, disappointing our **anticipation to enjoy the panoramic** view. We struggled downhills and **a wave of exhaustion hit us all, leaving us utterly worn out.**

**Reflecting on this adventure**, the unplanned mountain climb was both **physically and mentally draining**. ==Despite the fatigue==, the shared struggle with my fellow volunteers **forged a unique bond** and **became a memorable chapter** in our volunteering journey.

Recognizing that **arranging a family photoshoot in a photography studio** and subsequent framing could pose a ==financial challenge==, I embarked on a long-journey of **==financial planning==**. Diligently saving my allowances, trimming unnecessary expenses, and taking on extra responsibilities in student jobs, I finally **==secured enough funds== for this heartfelt gift**.

On the day of the scheduled shoot, **the surprise and joy** on my parents' faces made all the effort worthwhile. Throughout the session, our family **engaged in happy and natural ==interactions==**, with those **genuine smiles and heartfelt moments** warmly captured by the professional photographer.

### 7.十二点断电

#### 重要的规定

The rule I am going to tell you about is that my university would ==**cut off the electricity** of the dormitory== at twelve every evening, whether it is at the weekends or weekdays. But the **power supply** of the elevators and the lights in the corridor and the bathroom would be **sustained**, so that we would not run into something or have to climb the stairs at night.

Actually, there is ==no specific illustration== about what would happen if we break the rule. Perhaps, the primary reason for this **awkward situation** is that we can never do it.  **The keys of the circuit box** are **kept in the hands of officials** running the dormitory. It is impossible to steal them and **secretly turn on the switch**.

I think this rule is important because it basically ==**dictates our daily routine**== as we have to go to bed after the blackout, helping us to **develop the habit of early to bed and early to rise**. If we can **gain access to electricity** throughout the night, it is highly likely for us to **indulge in video games** and not go to sleep until the early morning.

There may be some **rationality behind this policy**, but I do not like it at all because it **causes great ==inconveniences==**. As college students, we **are doomed to stay up to complete the assignments** every now and then and to **revise for the final exams** at the end of the term. However, because of this rule, the **only option left to us to fulfil these tasks** is to go to a 24hour café or MacDonald nearby, which not only **generates extra expenditure** but also **dampens our efficiency** because of their noisy environment.

这一政策背后可能有一定的合理性，但我一定都不喜欢它，因为它带来极大的不便。作为大学生，我们注定时不时熬夜赶作业，或者在期末的时候熬夜复习考试。然而，因为这条规矩，我们完成这些任务的唯一选择就是前往附近24小时营业的咖啡厅或者麦当劳。这不仅会产生额外的费用，而且还会因为吵闹的环境而影响效率。



Good pharse：

- cut off the electricity, power supply, gain access to electricity
- dictate our daily routines, develop the habit of early to bed and early to rise

Last April, I went on ==**a memorable car trip**== with some college friends to Yunnan Province in China. We decided to self-drive so that we could have **the freedom to explore at our own pace** and truly **appreciate the stunning landscapes along the way**. 

Throughout our journey, we were absolutely ==**amazed by the breathtaking scenery**== of Yunnan, ranging from the **majestic Himalayas** to the mesmerizing **terraced rice fields** and **ancient towns** like Li Jiang, which really provided a **visual feast**.

- It's a good occasion to **let my hair down** and **blow off steam**
- It's a real **knees-up**
- The celebration do is **just the ticket**
- It goes without saying that some people are **reluctant to** attend any kind of parties, due to shyness or having an introverted or a conservative kind of character.
- face-to-face interactions
- It depends on one's character rather than where they are, if you ask me. I mean, party goers who drink **copious amount of alcohol** means it could **have a detrimental effect on one's vital organs** and mental health. Also if one is acting like **a couch potato, binge-watching movies** all day, isn't healthy either.
- In a nutshell, both aspects could be a **double-edged sword**

As the **==protagonist investigates and delves==** into this incident, he is drawn into **==a convoluted conspiracy== masterminded by** businessmen and politicians who **run criminal enterprises under the veneer of respectability**.

The beginning of the film provides plenty of **suspenses**. However, as the plot progressed, the ==**overwhelming intricacies and shady dealings**== among characters **led to a muddled storyline**, losing its initial momentum and left me confused. What's more, while the green-and-yellow ==**cinematography**== gaudily conveys **a pervading atmosphere of corruption,** it becomes quite **nauseating over the course of  two hours**.

In my opinion, "Under the Light" **pales in comparison to** Zhang's masterpieces, lacking the **intricate storytelling flair characteristic of his work**, and the **abrupt edits and traces of dubbing** ultimately render the film **a disappointing potboiler**.



### 16.爸爸做饭

#### Cook for others

For this topic, I'd like to introduce my father, who is undoubtedly the joyful and dominant force in our kitchen.

My dad, a **cheerful and slightly ==plump middle-aged man==**, is an absolute food enthusiast. Specializing in **crafting authentic Chinese cuisines**, he **possesses an exceptional ==sense of timing and heat control==**. One of his masterpieces is the red-braised pork, **surpassing even restaurant versions** with its perfect **chewiness and impeccable flavor**. From mouthwatering ribs to lamb soup, I am undeniably **hooked on his cooking**.

In the realm of cookery, my dad is undoubtedly a natural talent. He usually ==picks up new dishes **through his own experiments and exploration**==. With the increasing **popularity of videos for learning** in recent years, he has also ==**caught up with the trend** of learning cooking through videos==.

For my father, cooking is not a chore; it's a labor of love and a means of **connecting with people on a deeper level**. He finds joy in **witnessing the delight on people's faces** as they **savor his creations** and cherishes the conversations and memories created around the dining table. 



### 17.大学室友

#### 帮助他人的人

Allow me to introduce my dorm roommate in college as a ==**remarkable individual who consistently goes out of her way**== to help others. With her stunning eyes and warm smiles, she **possesses a kind-hearted nature** that radiates throughout our campus.

Notably, she **==excels academically== and willingly shares her knowledge with those in need**. Whenever we encounter difficulties in our studies, she readily **offers a lending hand** and **provides invaluable insights on those challenging math problems**. Additionally, she **generously shares her class notes**, which greatly aids our learning process. 

Moreover, **her generosity transcends beyond academics and extends to our daily lives**. Whenever we find ourselves ==**struggling emotionally or facing interpersonal conflicts**==, she **is always there to** offer **a supportive ear and provide guidance**. She is also keen on ==providing recommendations== when it comes to purchasing clothes or beauty products. One particular incident that stands out in my memory is when we went to ==McDonald's== together and encountered a foreigner who had difficulties in communicating with the waitress, she fearlessly stepped in to assist with conversation effectively.

It is evident that her **willingness to help ==stems from==** her outgoing and compassionate personality. She firmly believes that **building connections and spreading love through acts of kindness** is the key to meaningful relationships.



### 18. PS4线下体验店

#### 新开的商店/错误信息/不好的服务/人多的地方

Recently, a PS4 offiline store has opened its door near our campus. **Motivated by the enticing promotions** on social media, where **influencers promised exclusive previews and an unparalleled gaming experience**, I decided to check out the store for myself.

However, upon stepping into the newly opened store, I quickly realized that the influencers' **vivid representation** did not align with the reality. The store was **ill-prepared to handle the influx of customers**, where the overcrowded environment made it challenging to **explore the gaming consoles and accessories** at my own pace.

The service within the store was also disappointing. The staff seemed **overwhelmed**, with the high number of customers and limited manpower.Their attention was **divided among several customers**, leading to **minimal individualized instructions**. When I **sought clarification** on certain game aspects, my queries often **went unanswered due to the staff's preoccupation with** managing the crowded environment, leaving me somewhat dissatisfied.

In essence, while the idea of a new PS4 store was exciting, the actual experience **fell short** due to the overcrowded environment and poor service. **It served as a reminder** that the success of a gaming store **goes beyond** its **physical space; customer experience and efficient service** play pivotal roles in **creating a positive and memorable visit for gaming enthusiasts**.

(In essence, the visit to the PS4 offline store turned out to be a letdown, **with the gap between the influencers' promises and the actual experience** highlighting the importance of **genuine representation** in the gaming community. )
